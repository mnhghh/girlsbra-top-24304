                    <h1>Affiliate Disclaimer</h1>
                    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 15, 2025</p>
                    
                    <p>GirlsBra Top ("we," "our," or "us") believes in transparency and honesty in all our recommendations and reviews. This Affiliate Disclaimer explains our relationship with various retailers and how we maintain our commitment to providing unbiased, helpful content to our readers.</p>

                    <h2>Affiliate Relationships</h2>
                    <p>GirlsBra Top participates in various affiliate marketing programs, which means we may earn commissions from qualifying purchases made through links on our website. Our current affiliate partnerships include, but are not limited to:</p>
                    <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                        <li><strong>Amazon Associates Program:</strong> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com and its international variants.</li>
                        <li><strong>AliExpress Affiliate Program:</strong> We participate in the AliExpress affiliate program to provide links to products available on their platform.</li>
                        <li><strong>Other Retailer Programs:</strong> We may also participate in affiliate programs with other lingerie and clothing retailers.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>How Affiliate Links Work</h2>
                    <p>When you click on an affiliate link on our website and make a purchase, we may receive a small commission from the retailer at no additional cost to you. These commissions help support our website operations, allowing us to continue providing free content, guides, and tools like our bra size calculator.</p>

                    <p>Affiliate links are clearly marked with "affiliate link," "sponsored," or similar language where required by law. However, not all product links on our site are affiliate links – some are provided purely for your convenience.</p>

                    <h2>Our Commitment to Honest Reviews</h2>
                    <p>Our affiliate relationships do not influence our editorial content or product recommendations. We maintain strict editorial independence and are committed to providing honest, unbiased reviews and recommendations based on:</p>
                    <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                        <li>Thorough product research and testing when possible</li>
                        <li>Analysis of customer reviews and feedback</li>
                        <li>Consideration of product quality, value, and suitability for our audience</li>
                        <li>Our team's expertise in bra fitting and women's lingerie</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>We only recommend products that we genuinely believe will benefit our readers. If we have concerns about a product, we will clearly state them in our reviews, even if it means potentially losing affiliate commissions.</p>

                    <h2>Product Pricing and Availability</h2>
                    <p>Prices and availability of products mentioned on our website are subject to change without notice. We strive to keep pricing information current, but we cannot guarantee that all prices displayed are accurate or up-to-date. Always check the retailer's website for the most current pricing and availability information.</p>

                    <h2>No Guarantee of Results</h2>
                    <p>While we provide detailed reviews and recommendations, we cannot guarantee that any product will meet your specific needs or preferences. Bra fitting is highly individual, and what works well for one person may not work for another. We encourage you to:</p>
                    <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                        <li>Use our bra size calculator as a starting point</li>
                        <li>Read multiple reviews before making a purchase</li>
                        <li>Check the retailer's return policy before buying</li>
                        <li>Consider trying products in-store when possible</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Sponsored Content</h2>
                    <p>Occasionally, we may publish sponsored content or accept products for review from manufacturers or retailers. All sponsored content is clearly labeled as such and follows the same editorial standards as our regular content. Sponsored relationships do not guarantee positive reviews – we maintain our commitment to honest, helpful content regardless of compensation.</p>

                    <h2>Third-Party Websites</h2>
                    <p>Our website contains links to third-party websites, including retailer sites where you can purchase recommended products. We are not responsible for the content, privacy policies, or practices of these third-party sites. We encourage you to review the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any website you visit through our links.</p>

                    <h2>Changes to This Disclaimer</h2>
                    <p>We may update this Affiliate Disclaimer from time to time to reflect changes in our affiliate relationships or legal requirements. We will post any changes on this page and update the "Last updated" date. We encourage you to review this disclaimer periodically.</p>

                    <h2>Questions and Contact Information</h2>
                    <p>If you have any questions about our affiliate relationships or this disclaimer, please don't hesitate to contact us:</p>

                    <h2>Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Compliance</h2>
                    <p>GirlsBra Top complies with the Federal Trade Commission's guidelines regarding affiliate marketing and endorsements. We are committed to transparency in our affiliate relationships and will continue to clearly disclose when content contains affiliate links or is sponsored.</p>
