      <h2>📏 2. How to Measure Your Bra Size</h2>
      <p>Measuring your bra size is easier than you think! You only need a measuring tape and a mirror.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1: Band Size</strong> — Measure directly under your bust. Round to the nearest whole number.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2: Bust Size</strong> — Measure around the fullest part of your breasts.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3: Cup Size</strong> — Subtract the band size from the bust size. The difference gives your cup size:
          <ul>
            <li>1" = A cup</li>
            <li>2" = B cup</li>
            <li>3" = C cup</li>
            <li>... and so on</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

        <li>Straps shouldn’t dig into your shoulders or slip off.</li>
        <li>Adjust the cups by "scooping and swooping" your breast tissue into them.</li>
