                <h2>Why a Good Sports Bra is Important</h2>
                <p>A high-quality sports bra is essential for comfort and support during physical activity. It minimizes breast movement, reduces strain on your back and shoulders, and prevents long-term sagging. Choosing the right one depends on your activity level and body type.</p>

                <h3>1. Understand Impact Levels</h3>
                <p>Sports bras are designed for three levels of impact:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Low-Impact:</strong> Ideal for activities like yoga, walking, and stretching. They offer light compression and comfort.</li>
                    <li><strong>Medium-Impact:</strong> Perfect for brisk walking, cycling, and light gym training. They provide more support and compression.</li>
                    <li><strong>High-Impact:</strong> Necessary for running, aerobics, and high-intensity interval training (HIIT). These offer maximum support and encapsulation to reduce bounce significantly.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Find Your Correct Size</h3>
                <p>Just like a regular bra, a proper fit is crucial. Your sports bra's band should be snug but not restrictive. You should be able to fit two fingers underneath it. The cups should fully contain your breasts without spillage or gaps.</p>
                <p>Use our <a href="../calculator.html">Bra Size Calculator</a> to get an accurate starting point, but remember that sizes can vary between brands.</p>

                <div class="card" style="background-color: var(--primary-light); padding: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0;">
                    <h4>Quick Tip:</h4>
                    <p style="color: var(--text-primary);">When trying on a sports bra, jump up and down a few times. If you feel secure and supported with minimal bounce, you've likely found a good fit!</p>
                </div>

                <h3>3. Choose the Right Type</h3>
                <p>There are two main types of sports bras:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Compression Bras:</strong> These bras press your breasts against your chest to limit movement. They are typically best for smaller cup sizes (A and B).</li>
                    <li><strong>Encapsulation Bras:</strong> These have individual cups that surround and support each breast separately. They look more like traditional bras and are ideal for larger cup sizes (C and above).</li>
                </ul>
